          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
            My name is Subu and I'm currently a UX Designer at Selective Insurance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
            As a creative designer, I provide unique perceptions on challenges and bring fresh ideas to the table. 
            My curiosity and the drive to ask the “why” allow me to dig deeper into problems and create solutions with empathy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
            While following my passion for creating products & solutions that add value to people's lives, 
            I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams at Selective, Rangam, Beautyocracy, and The Moment Studio.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
            Besides designing, I enjoy cooking, spending time in nature, taking pictures, and working on my DIY projects!
